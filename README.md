# üìÖ Calendar for UniPG SOL: Simplify Your Scheduling

<img align="right" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/490ff3ef-785a-4bb9-a520-019146b9300f">
I was fed up with the clunky and unhelpful UniPG SOL platform, so I decided to take matters into my own hands and created this script to simplify my own exam management.  
<br/>
<br/>
With this script, you can easily export exam dates to your preferred calendar, making it easier to stay on top of your academic schedule.
